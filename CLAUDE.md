# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**docket.pub** — a municipal meeting intelligence platform that ingests, parses, and indexes public meeting records from Alabama cities (Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery, Hoover, Homewood, Vestavia Hills). The goal is civic transparency: make local government dockets searchable and link every data point back to the original source document.

Domain: `docket.pub` | Status: **Private Development Phase** | Repo: `thinkdarrell/docket-pub`

This project builds on work from the [al-municipal-meetings](https://github.com/thinkdarrell/al-municipal-meetings) repo (Birmingham-focused Granicus scraper with vote OCR). docket.pub generalizes that into a multi-city platform with a public-facing web interface.

## Architecture

### Adapter-per-platform pattern

Every municipal data source is accessed through a platform adapter implementing `MunicipalSourceAdapter` (in `models/protocol.py`). The rest of the system never knows which CMS a city uses.

Supported platforms: Granicus, CivicClerk, CivicPlus, Generic CMS.

Adding a new city on a supported platform = one row in `municipalities` table + council member data.

### Service layer is canonical

Every entry point (Flask route, CLI, pipeline) calls into `docket.services.*`. Services own DB transactions. Adapters and analysis modules live underneath.

### Data Honesty Protocol

- Every data point links back to the original source on the city's website
- Inline source badges on votes: "Video OCR - High confidence" / "Official Minutes" / "API"
- Footer attribution with direct links to original documents
- When video OCR and official minutes disagree, both are shown with a "Sources disagree" flag
- Missing data is honestly reported, never hidden

### Scoring model

Two independent 0-10 scores on every agenda item (NULL until AI features enabled):
- **Significance score:** How impactful is this item?
- **Consent placement score:** Should this be on the consent agenda?

### Dollar amount tiers

All dollar amounts extracted, displayed with color-coded tiers:
- Green: < $50K | Yellow: $50-250K | Orange: $250K-1M | Red: > $1M

## Conventions

- Package name: `docket` (under `src/docket/`)
- All Python modules use absolute imports rooted at `docket.*`
- Environment secrets go in `.env`, never committed
- Web routes are thin — business logic belongs in `services/`
- Adapter modules live in `adapters/`, one module per platform type
- PostgreSQL connection via `docket.db.db()` or `docket.db.db_cursor()`

## Development Workflow

Single repo: `thinkdarrell/docket-pub`. `main` is the source of truth and what Railway deploys. Feature work goes on `feat/*` branches and merges back via PR.

(Historical note: this used to be a "dev fork" workflow split across `docket-pub` and `docket-pub-dw-dev`. As of 2026-05-03 those were consolidated; the abandoned skeleton lives at `thinkdarrell/docket-pub-archived` for history. Pre-consolidation safety tags `pre-consolidation/*` are preserved on `origin`.)

### Rules

- **Build and test here freely.** Feature branches are the sandbox.
- **Commit frequently with clear messages.** Each phase of work gets its own commit.
- **Port code from `al-municipal-meetings`, don't copy blindly.** Adapt for PostgreSQL, multi-city, and the adapter protocol. The original repo uses SQLite and is Birmingham-only.
- **Test against live data when possible.** The Granicus adapter should be tested against `bhamal.granicus.com`. Use polite delays (1s+) between requests.
- **Deploy: `railway up --detach` from `main`** — Railway has no GitHub auto-deploy here; deploys are CLI-pushed Docker images. (Don't use `railway redeploy` — restarts the old build.)

| Impact-First Refactor — Phase 1 | Done | Migration 013 (10 new tables, 16 indexes, mv_badge_volume_monthly, 11 priority_badge_templates, BHM mayoral_terms, agenda_items v3 columns) + Wave 0 non-LLM classifier (`src/docket/ai/wave0.py`, `_priority.py`). Sets `data_quality`, `data_debt_priority`, `processing_status` on every item via Stage 0a (data-quality gate with Big Fish Override + title fallback for Granicus adapter shape) and Stage 0b (Alabama-context procedural regex). **Live on Railway as of 2026-05-07.** Final Wave 0 distribution on 57,553 items: 37,475 pending (65%), 16,169 data_quality_skipped (28%), 3,909 procedural_skipped (7%). 61 tests. Tag: `refactor-impact-first-phase-1-shipped`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-05-impact-first-refactor-design.md`. |
| Impact-First Refactor — Phase 2 | ~88% — In progress | v3 pipeline (Stage 1 extraction + Stage 2 Smart Brevity rewrite + Stage 2.5 score floors + reconcile), 7 process badges + 4 BHM policy badges, Smart Brevity Card UI (6 variants), category landing pages, admin views, backfill driver. 3-track decomposition (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-06-impact-first-phase-2-coordination.md`). **Track 1 done** (Section A — Stage 1 extraction worker, on `feat/impact-first-phase-2`). **Track 2 done** (Sections B1-B4 + C process badges + D policy badges, on `feat/impact-first-phase-2-track-2`). **Track 3 15/17 done (~88%)** (on `feat/impact-first-phase-2-track-3`, HEAD `c50cf20` as of 2026-05-10): A8 cross-task + Section E (E1-E6 Smart Brevity Card + SMART_BREVITY_UI flag) + Section F complete (F1 `list_items_by_badge` + F2 category landing route/template + F3 SVG volume timeline + F4 cross-filter HTMX dropdown + Browse-by-Priority + F5 public data-debt page + RSS feeds) + G1 calibration dashboard + G2 admin OCR queue + errors queue with retry/escalate handlers + G3 badge audit log viewer + manual badge HTMX endpoints + Migration 016 (audit FK relaxed to ON DELETE SET NULL). Suite: 1122 passed + 4 xfailed (with one date-sensitive G1 flake deselected — task #48 follow-up). Remaining in Track 3: G4 cross-stage conflict resolution UI (decision #93), then B5 atomic process_item() convergence wires Tracks 1+2+3 together; Section H backfill driver foundations; FINAL-1 through FINAL-4 deploy + flag flip. |
| Impact-First Refactor — Phase 3 | Not built | Backfill execution: ~$100 over 7-14 days for ~37K LLM-eligible items via Anthropic Batches API. Plan exists at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-06-impact-first-refactor-phase-3.md`. |
| Impact-First Refactor — Phase 4 | Not built | Cleanup + Migration 014 (drop legacy `summary` column once all completed items are at v3). Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-06-impact-first-refactor-phase-4.md`. |
| Source reconciliation | Not built | Compare video OCR vs official minutes |
| Freshness checks | Not built | Nightly auto-check + manual trigger |
| Public API | Not built | Flask blueprint for `/api/v1/` (deferred — security concern) |
| Astro frontend | Deferred | Evaluate Astro as Flask/Jinja2+HTMX replacement |

### Key decisions to preserve

- **PostgreSQL from day 1** — no SQLite fallback
- **AI summaries + scoring:** items use Haiku 4.5, meetings use Sonnet 4.6. Two-phase meeting lifecycle keyed off `minutes_adopted_at` (provisional → adopted overwrites the executive summary). NULL `topic` renders as `"Uncategorized"` in prompts (never the literal `"None"`). Daily budget gate via `AI_DAILY_BUDGET_USD`; bumping `ITEM_PROMPT_VERSION` re-cascades both stages automatically. Worker writes per-row using `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so multiple instances are safe.
- **Procedural items (item prompt v2):** Roll Call, Pledge, Invocation, "Minutes Not Ready" notices etc. get `is_substantive=false`, null scores, empty summary, and empty rationales. Title is the source of truth — a paraphrase would be noise. Template renders nothing extra for these.
- **Distinctive vs routine in meeting summaries (meeting prompt v2):** worker pre-classifies items by `significance_score` before feeding Sonnet. Sig ≥ 6 → distinctive, rendered in full and Sonnet leads with them. Sig < 6 → routine, grouped by topic with counts ("33 demolitions, 18 public_safety, 12 contracts") so Sonnet treats the cluster as one closing background sentence at most. Without this split, recurring abatements/demolitions dominated the framing.
- **Schema length caps:** rationales 1500 chars, item summaries 400 chars, executive summaries 1500 chars. Original 600/800 caps were rejecting Haiku/Sonnet's longer-but-correct outputs.
- **Cost expectation:** ~$0.0026/item (Haiku, with cache), ~$0.0085/meeting (Sonnet). 57K item backfill ≈ $140, ~14 days at default $10/day cap.
- **Local CLI runs against prod DB:** use `DATABASE_URL=$(railway variables --service docket-web --kv | grep DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL | cut -d= -f2-) ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(railway variables --service docket-web --kv | grep '^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=' | cut -d= -f2-) venv/bin/python -m docket.ai.cli ...`. The internal `postgres.railway.internal` hostname only resolves inside Railway's VPC.
- **Two scoring dimensions:** significance (0-10) + consent placement (0-10)
- **Dollar tiers:** green <$50K, yellow $50-250K, orange $250K-1M, red >$1M
- **Source overlap:** video OCR + official minutes coexist, flag discrepancies only
- **Council rosters:** scrape council pages, don't manually seed
- **Search:** PostgreSQL FTS (tsvector/tsquery), not a separate engine
- **Data Honesty:** inline badges + footer attribution + discrepancy flags
- **Silent Break alerts:** dashboard + email notifications
- **Deployment:** Railway (live), gunicorn, production cookies, Procfile
- **Vote sources:** Minutes PDF (~9,934 minutes_text votes across 788 meetings), video OCR (77 votes, Jan–Apr 2026). Consent-block votes get 1:N coverage (one vote → many items), and that's the dominant link source — **33,303 active links** across Birmingham post-backfill (21,695 consent_block_named + 10,688 consent_block_default + 606 consent_enumerated + 162 resolution_number + 77 timestamp + 57 text_similarity + 18 item_number). 32,383 are provisional, 920 are official; 96 meetings have `minutes_adopted_at` set. Vote-level match rate is 10.7% (1,067 of 9,934) — the rest are substantive votes whose minutes don't reference a resolution/item number or carry strong title-keyword overlap, a known data limitation.
- **Vote matching:** Timestamp proximity for OCR votes (bisect, ported from al-municipal-meetings), text heuristics for minutes votes (resolution number, item number, keyword overlap). Each vote is first classified substantive vs consent_block; substantive runs 3-tier matching, consent_block runs named-callout + default-fill passes.
- **N:M vote↔agenda links:** `vote_agenda_items` join table — one consent vote can link to many items. Named callouts get `match_confidence=1.0`, default consent fill gets `0.8`.
- **Provisional → Official lifecycle:** `consent_named` and `consent_implicit` links insert with `provisional=TRUE`. They flip to `FALSE` when council adopts the minutes (sweep_adoptions sets `meetings.minutes_adopted_at`, then strict re-parse promotes the links). Substantive (`explicit`) links insert with `provisional=FALSE` directly.
- **Manual shield:** `is_manual=TRUE` on a `vote_agenda_items` row protects it from automated overwrite — enforced both by an app-level pre-check in `_upsert_link` and a DB-level `WHERE is_manual = FALSE` predicate on every UPDATE.
- **Active vs ghost links:** `is_active=FALSE` marks links to items that were on the consent agenda at meeting time but pulled out and voted separately. Kept for audit; hidden from the default reader (`Vote.active_links`).
- **Strict re-parse safety:** when the enumerated consent list resolves to zero target agenda items, `strict_reparse_meeting` aborts (does NOT mass-deactivate). Protects against PDF/OCR glitches that could otherwise wipe every active consent link in the meeting.
- **Dual-trigger contract:** `strict_reparse_meeting` fires from both the matcher (when matching a meeting whose `minutes_adopted_at` is already non-NULL) and the sweep (when newly flipping a meeting NULL → adopted). Order independent — either path lands the same end state.
- **Video OCR:** Import `muni.analysis` from al-municipal-meetings (installed in venv), don't re-port
- **Council member linking:** Dynamic name→ID resolution using roster + term dates, not hardcoded maps
- **Deploy:** `railway up --detach` (NOT `railway redeploy` which restarts old build without new code)
- **Minutes parser:** Must handle curly apostrophes (U+2019) in name regex — O'Quinn fix. Pre-vote window is 1500 chars (was 500, last 200) so the resolution body is captured into `votes.raw_text`.
- **Cron worker:** Railway `worker` service (separate from `docket-web`, same image) runs `python -m docket.worker.scheduler` 24/7. Five tasks staggered hourly in `America/Chicago`: `repair_empty_agendas` Mon 05:00, `ingest_all` 06:00, `ai_items` 07:00, `ai_meetings` 08:00, `vote_matching` 09:00. Each pings Healthchecks.io start/success/fail with traceback body on exception (5 UUIDs in env vars). `BudgetExceededError` swallowed in AI tasks — expected behavior, not failure. Per-city ingest failures isolated (Birmingham failing won't block Mobile). Manual triggers via `railway ssh --service worker` then `python -m docket.worker.scheduler --run-once <task>` — NOT `railway run` (which executes locally where `postgres.railway.internal` doesn't resolve). Runbook at `docs/runbooks/cron-worker.md`.
- **Procfile multi-process gotcha:** Railway only runs the `web:` line by default. The `worker:` line in Procfile is informational; the actual worker is a separate Railway service whose Custom Start Command overrides Procfile. One-time setup via dashboard (Empty Service → Custom Start Command → copy env vars from `docket-web`). Re-deploy with `railway up --service worker --detach` from `~/docket-pub`.
- **Custom domain (live 2026-05-04):** apex `docket.pub` is on Railway with auto-provisioned Let's Encrypt cert. DNS at Namecheap: `CNAME @ → zu815cqb.up.railway.app` + `TXT _railway-verify=...`. HSTS shipped (1 year, no `includeSubDomains` yet). **`www.docket.pub` is NOT yet on Railway** — currently a Namecheap URL Redirect Record (HTTP-only). Pickup: delete the URL Redirect, add `www.docket.pub` as second Railway custom domain, replace with the CNAME Railway provides, add Flask `before_request` redirect from `www.docket.pub` to apex, then tighten HSTS to `includeSubDomains` (and consider `preload`).
- **HSTS header:** `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` set in `web/__init__.py` `after_request` when `FLASK_ENV != "development"`. `includeSubDomains` intentionally omitted until www is also Railway-served (otherwise browsers would force-upgrade www to HTTPS and fail).
- **Wave 0 title-fallback rule:** `evaluate_data_quality` in `src/docket/ai/wave0.py` treats `title` as the body when `description` and `raw_text` are both empty AND title is >= 120 chars. This handles the Granicus adapter (Birmingham) shape where the full agenda body sits in `title` and `description` is NULL — without this rule, Wave 0 misclassifies 90% of the Birmingham archive as `no_agenda_text`. Fix landed in `9332811` after the first Wave 0 production run on 2026-05-06 caught the bug.
- **Impact-First Refactor pipeline directionality:** The v2 AI pipeline (item summaries + executive summaries via Haiku/Sonnet) is what's currently live. The v3 pipeline (Phase 2 in flight) replaces the legacy `summary` column with the structured `extracted_facts` (JSONB) + `headline` + `why_it_matters` v3 outputs and adds 0/1/2/2.5 stages. v2 keeps running until `IMPACT_FIRST_ENABLED=true` flips the worker to v3, then `SMART_BREVITY_UI=true` flips citizen rendering. Migration 014 (Phase 4) drops the legacy `summary` column. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-05-impact-first-refactor-design.md`.

### Local PostgreSQL setup

If not using Docker, PostgreSQL 16 can be run via Homebrew:
```bash
# Start
/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin/pg_ctl -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@16 start

# Stop
/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin/pg_ctl -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@16 stop

# Create DB (first time only)
/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin/createuser -s docket
/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin/createdb -O docket docket_db
```

Then set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://docket@localhost:5432/docket_db` in `.env`.
